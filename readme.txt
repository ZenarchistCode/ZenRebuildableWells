[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds the ability to rebuild defunct wells. It requires all the attached materials + a sledgehammer or pickaxe to build, and is persistent.

Required materials: 4 planks, 50 nails, 4 stones, 1 metal wire and 1 metal pipe.

Click here to see which wells I mean - they're all over Livonia + Chernarus: https://github.com/ZenarchistCode/ZenModPack/wiki/Zen's-Rebuildable-Wells

They're usually in remote areas, great for building an off-grid home!

The server types config allows admins to specify how long the wells last for once rebuilt.

By default, wells last forever (until server is wiped). To reduce their lifetime check my instructions on the GitHub page linked above.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be run on both client and server.

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

[h1]Buy Me A Coffee:[/h1]

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
